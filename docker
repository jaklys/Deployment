Dear Trading Team,

I wanted to update you on the recent migration of our applications from the old servers (fiat-ldnprod and fiat-ldndr) to the new servers (fiat-emeaprod-a1 and fiat-emeaprod-a2). The migration has been successfully completed, and all applications on the old servers have been shut down, with the sole exception of ParamService.

If you have any custom scripts that reference the old servers, it is essential that you update them to point to the new server locations immediately. This also applies to the .xls file located at [insert file path]. The file has been updated, so if you are working with a local copy, please make sure to download the latest version from the shared drive, or adjust your parameters accordingly.

Please note that ParamService on the old servers will be shut down this weekend. If you do not download the modified version from the shared drive and update your scripts, they will stop functioning next week.

Your prompt attention to these changes is crucial to avoid any disruptions.

If you need assistance or have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
