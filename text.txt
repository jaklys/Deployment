Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an adjustment to our current firewall rules to facilitate seamless communication between our Comet_API application and Barclays Live.

This request is not for a new communication link; rather, it is a part of our ongoing remediation effort to migrate from our old Windows 2012 servers to the new Windows 2019 servers. Our objective is to ensure that the firewall rules are adjusted to mirror the settings on our old servers, specifically concerning the Comet_API application that communicates over TCP port 10888.

However, to accommodate future implementations and to enhance our infrastructure's resilience, we are requesting an expansion of the allowed port range to include the entire range of 10880 - 10890. This expansion is critical for us to implement a load balancer, which will allow us to distribute the load effectively and ensure optimal performance and reliability of our services.

We understand the importance of maintaining strict security measures and assure you that this request is in line with our commitment to security and operational excellence. We believe that with your support in adjusting these firewall rules, we can achieve a seamless transition to our new servers without compromising on security or performance.

Please let us know if you require any further information or if there are specific procedures we should follow to facilitate this request. We are keen to work closely with your team to ensure that this adjustment is made promptly and efficiently.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and your ongoing support.
